## The Agent Cemetery Problem

I've watched it happen at dozens of enterprises across LATAM. A team builds an agent, it works in the proof-of-concept, and then it dies in production. Gartner forecasts that 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. That's growth. But there's a darker story underneath the optimism.

Deloitte surveyed 3,235 respondents across 24 countries in 2026 and found that 75% of enterprises plan agentic AI deployment within two years. Only 34% report using AI to deeply transform their business. The gap between intention and transformation isn't luck. It's engineering debt. And it's predictable.

KPMG's quarterly tracking of 130 US executives captures what actually happens. Agent deployment surged from 11% in Q1 to 42% in Q3 2025, then pulled back sharply to 26% in Q4 as leaders shifted from pilots to production-grade systems. That deceleration isn't market saturation. It's the moment when organizations realize what production actually demands.

And the scale of adoption makes the stakes real. A study of 128,018 GitHub projects found that 22 to 28% already use coding agents as of February 2026, with accelerating growth since March 2025[6]. Meanwhile, 79% of developers report using GenAI tools daily, with 70%+ saying they cut boilerplate and documentation time in half[7]. But here's the telling asymmetry: the earliest phases of the SDLC, requirements and planning, show markedly lower AI adoption than implementation and testing[7]. Teams are automating the easy parts (code generation) while skipping the hard parts (specification, intent). That's exactly backwards, and it's why the cemetery keeps growing.

Most teams don't confront it successfully. Here's the pattern I see: Pilot agents fail to reach production for one consistent reason. They lack a coherent, multi-layer engineering foundation. Instead of strategy, teams react. They grab an LLM, hand it a task, declare victory when the proof-of-concept completes. That same agent, asked to handle production variance, fails silently. Asked to explain its reasoning, it can't. Asked to scale to ten concurrent users, it collapses. The organization marks it a loss, shelves the code, and starts the next pilot. The agent cemetery grows.

This playbook exists because that pattern isn't inevitable. It's engineered.

## Three Types of Debt in AI-Native Development

Technical debt is familiar. You've built codebases weighed down by accumulated patches, fragile dependencies, brittle tests. AI-native development inherits this and introduces two new forms.

**Cognitive debt** happens when developers accept AI-generated code without understanding it. Storey (2026) calls this "cognitive surrender," the state where understanding never forms because the developer assumes the LLM is correct and moves forward. Understanding doesn't get recovered later. It was never built in the first place. Over time, your codebase becomes orphaned knowledge: nobody can modify it safely because nobody understands why it works. I've seen this paralyze teams when they inherit AI-written agents.

**Intent debt** is worse. It arises when objectives, constraints, and decision rationale are never captured in artifacts. The agent was built to optimize for metric X, under constraint Y, with hidden assumption Z baked in. When production conditions shift, the agent optimizes for the wrong thing. Not because it's broken, but because the specification was never actually written down. Intent debt makes agents brittle across context boundaries and unfit for reuse.

Liu et al. (2026) analyzed 304,362 AI-generated commits across 6,275 GitHub repositories. The findings hit hard: AI-generated code introduced significantly higher shares of requirement debt and test debt compared to human-written code. The debt compounds. Unmaintained tests mean drift goes undetected. Uncaptured requirements mean the agent optimizes for surface-level success, not actual business need.

A causal study from CMU using the AIDev dataset quantified what this actually looks like in production: coding agents cause an 18% increase in static-analysis warnings and a 39% increase in cognitive complexity[8]. Worse, this technical debt accumulates persistently. It doesn't self-correct. And velocity gains from agents only appear when the agent is the first AI tool introduced to a project; prior AI IDE exposure yields minimal or short-lived throughput increases[8]. The implication is uncomfortable: if you're already using AI tools without governance, adding agents on top makes the debt problem worse, not better.

Here's what gets me: ignoring these debts doesn't defer the cost. It distributes it. To the maintainer who discovers the code is incomprehensible. To the business stakeholder whose metric plummets when context shifts. To the team that tries to debug an agent that can't explain itself.

## The Inverted Perception vs. Reality

Most teams I talk to assume AI-augmented development shortens delivery cycles. A randomized controlled trial by METR examined 16 experienced open-source developers using AI tools. The result inverted everything: AI tools increased completion time by 19%, despite developers estimating a 20% speedup. The developers felt productive while becoming measurably slower.

That gap reveals a dangerous blind spot. When a tool makes you feel capable, you often can't detect that it's made you less effective. Perception and outcome diverge. In production where variants and edge cases aren't visible during development, this misalignment becomes costly: the agent passes testing, fails in production, and your team has no clear path to understanding why.

The tool isn't the problem. The absence of measurable feedback loops, captured intent, and layered engineering discipline is. Tools amplify precision when used within clear specifications. Without them, tools amplify uncertainty.

There's also a human development cost that rarely gets discussed. A randomized experiment by Anthropic researchers found that AI use during learning reduces library-specific skill acquisition by 17% (Cohen's d = 0.738, p = 0.010)[9]. Three interaction patterns preserve skills (conceptual inquiry, hybrid code-explanation, generation-then-comprehension), but the default pattern, where developers accept generated code without engaging with the concepts, erodes exactly the knowledge needed to maintain and debug AI-assisted systems[9]. Teams that skip the understanding step create a workforce that can prompt but can't reason.

And the strategic context is even broader. An analysis of 236 occupations found that 93.2% face moderate displacement risk (ATE >= 0.35) from agentic AI by 2030[10]. The 17 categories most resilient to displacement are all in human-AI collaboration and AI governance roles[10]. In other words, the skills this playbook teaches (governing agents, encoding intent, engineering context) are precisely the capabilities that remain valuable. The teams that invest in these disciplines aren't just building better agents. They're building the careers that survive automation.

## The Solution: Four Layers

Vishnyakova (2026) puts it cleanly: "Whoever controls the agent's context controls its behavior; whoever controls its intent controls its strategy; whoever controls its specifications controls its scale." Context, intent, and specifications aren't optional. They're foundational. And they rest on platform infrastructure.

AI-native development requires four interdependent layers of engineering discipline. Each layer solves distinct problems. No layer can substitute for another.

![The Context Platform Stack Pyramid](img_context_platform_stack_pyramid.png)

**Layer 1: Cloud & Infrastructure** provides the compute foundation. GPUs, Kubernetes clusters, CNCF-managed services. This isn't where engineering distinguishes itself, but it's where it breaks if you neglect it. It's table stakes, borrowed from well-established DevOps practice. Chapter 1 covers essentials for LATAM enterprise contexts where infrastructure is often shared, regulated, and cost-sensitive.

**Layer 2: Platform Engineering** builds the golden paths, guardrails, and access controls that enable safe agent deployment at scale. An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) creates consistency: standardized logging, secret management, observability hooks, RBAC. Without this layer, every team builds agents in isolation, with heterogeneous monitoring, divergent failure modes, and no reusable patterns. Chapter 2 addresses platform design for organizations where legacy systems and new agents must coexist.

**Layer 3: Context Engineering** is where most teams fail to invest. This layer assembles the agent's situational knowledge: Adaptive Context Engines (ACE), skill definitions, memory architectures, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Context isn't a prompt. It's a structured, versioned, measurable artifact that determines what the agent can and cannot do. An agent without layered context is a chatbot with delusions of capability. Chapter 3 details how to architect context so agents remain predictable as scale and complexity increase.

**Layer 4: Intent Engineering** captures specification, governance, and objectives in machine-readable form. Intent is the inverse of cognitive debt: explicit capture of what the agent is supposed to do, under what constraints, with what priorities. When intent is clear, agents become debuggable and auditable. When it's absent, agents are black boxes that fail unpredictably. Chapter 4 provides frameworks for intent specification that survive handoff between teams and changes in production conditions.

These four layers aren't sequential steps; they're co-dependencies. A robust platform without intent capture produces scaled chaos. Intent without context engineering produces specifications nobody can build to. Context without platform engineering produces islands of capability that can't be operated. And all of it rests on infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and designed for failure.

There's also a sixth chapter to this story, and it became necessary in February 2026. The four layers tell you what to build. They don't tell you how to operate it as a coherent agent in production. That operating discipline got named in early 2026 and the field calls it harness engineering. Chapter 6 covers that discipline: how the four layers compose into a production-grade harness, how the harness is governed across the lifecycle of the agent, and how you implement that harness through one of two accelerators (Three Horizons Accelerator on Red Hat Developer Hub plus ARO, or Open Horizons on Backstage plus AKS) on a shared Microsoft foundation. Read Chapters 1 to 5 first if you're new to the framework. Read Chapter 6 when you're ready to turn the framework into an operating model.

## How to Use This Playbook

This playbook is written for Platform Engineering Leads and AI-Native Tech Leads in LATAM enterprise environments who carry 5-15 years of systems or software engineering experience. You understand DevOps, infrastructure-as-code, microservices, and the operational costs of distributed systems. You're extending that expertise into agent-native development now and are frustrated by the gap between vendor promises and production reality.

Each chapter covers one layer or one operating concern. You don't need to read them sequentially, but the logic of the stack is cumulative: infrastructure enables platform, platform enables context, context enables intent, and harness engineering operates all of it as a production system. Starting from scratch? Read Chapters 1 through 4 in order, then Chapter 5 for integration, then Chapter 6 for the operating model. Already have Kubernetes and want to focus on agent architecture? Start with Chapter 2 or 3. Already operating agents and want to formalize the operating model? Start with Chapter 6.

Within each chapter, you'll find:
- Conceptual foundations: what the layer solves and why it matters
- Implementation patterns: specific, tested approaches for LATAM enterprise constraints (regulatory alignment, cost sensitivity, legacy integration)
- Decision trees: how to choose between competing approaches
- Failure modes: what breaks when this layer is neglected or mis-implemented
- Observability checkpoints: how to measure whether the layer is working

This playbook uses real systems and open standards wherever possible. You won't find vendor lock-in recommendations. You'll find references to CNCF projects, established frameworks, and industry-standard patterns adapted to agentic AI in enterprise environments.

Use this playbook as a reference during design reviews, architectural decisions, and post-mortem analysis. When an agent fails in production, these four layers provide a diagnostic framework: Which layer failed? Which layer was never built? Chapter 6 then gives you the operating-model lens: which guide is missing, which sensor is missing, which gate is missing? The combination will guide you toward sustainable solutions instead of patches.

The agent cemetery exists because teams optimized for pilots, not production. This playbook inverts that priority. Read it, apply it, and stop building agents you'll have to bury.
