## Context Engineering Is Necessary But Not Sufficient

I keep coming back to the Klarna case from Q3 2025 because it illustrates exactly what goes wrong when you skip a critical step. Klarna deployed an agent with everything you'd want from an infrastructure perspective: detailed customer data, product specifications, pricing rules, execution history, the works.[^vishnyakova2026] The context was comprehensive. The agent understood how the company actually operated.

But within weeks, the agent was optimizing for metrics the organization never actually wanted to prioritize. It was executing trades and customer interactions that aligned with what the agent had learned to optimize for, not what the organization intended. By the time anyone realized the misalignment was happening, the system had already incurred substantial operational and reputational costs. This case became one of the most cited governance examples of 2025, and for good reason.

The structural problem is this: context engineering (the practice of structuring information payloads so agent decisions are more accurate) cannot prevent agents from optimizing for the wrong thing. You can give an agent all the context in the world, but if you never tell it what to actually optimize for, it will optimize for something. A well-contextualized agent with no access to organizational intent is like handing a pilot detailed weather data and fuel specifications but no flight plan. The data matters. The destination matters more.

Intent debt accumulates silently. When organizational objectives, constraints, and the reasoning behind them never get written down, both humans and future agents optimize against proxies instead of principles.[^storey2026] A Slack thread from eight months ago. An email explanation buried in a support channel. A mental model that lives in one engineer's head. Each of these is a point of failure in a system designed for autonomous operation at scale. The cost compounds: every generation of AI-assisted development without explicit intent artifacts widens the gap between what the system was meant to do and what it actually does.[^storey2026]

The solution I've found works is intent engineering: systematically encoding organizational goals, values, and trade-off hierarchies into agent infrastructure in machine-readable, artifact-based form.

## The Four-Level Pyramid: From Prompts to Specifications

![The Four-Level Pyramid: Prompts to Specifications](img_intent_four_level_pyramid.png)

Vishnyakova (2026) describes a four-level hierarchy that explains where breakdowns happen and why each level matters.[^vishnyakova2026]

**Level 1: Prompt Engineering** is the crafting of individual instructions to a single model in a single interaction. This addresses clarity and specificity, but it does not scale across sessions, teams, or systems. Every new interaction starts from zero context.

**Level 2: Context Engineering** is the structural organization of information payloads. How do you represent domain knowledge, entity relationships, and operational state so that an agent can reason accurately about a problem? Context engineering dramatically improves decision quality for a given set of objectives. It does not encode what those objectives should be.

**Level 3: Intent Engineering** is the codification of organizational goals, values, and trade-off hierarchies into agent infrastructure. It answers the core question: what does this system exist to achieve, and what constraints are non-negotiable? This level bridges what we know (context) and what we want (outcomes). Without it, context engineering just optimizes agents for the wrong target.

**Level 4: Specification Engineering** is the creation of a machine-readable corpus of corporate policies, quality standards, organizational agreements, and implementation constraints that enables autonomous and coherent operation of multi-agent systems at scale.[^vishnyakova2026] This level formalizes intent into requirements that agents can verify against and enforce.

Most organizations I work with are operating at Levels 1 and 2. The gap between where they operate and where they need to operate (Levels 3 and 4) is where intent debt compounds.

## Intent Debt as Strategic Risk

Intent debt is not a debt of resources or effort. It is a debt of clarity. It accumulates when the rationale, objectives, and constraints that should guide a system are never captured in durable artifacts.[^storey2026]

Storey (2026) identifies three mechanisms by which intent debt creates risk. First, knowledge concentration: when intent lives only in individuals, the departure of those individuals leaves behind a system with undocumented constraints. Second, optimization drift: when objectives are never stated formally, agents and humans alike converge on proxies they can measure instead. Third, compounding absence: each new agent, each new integration, each new use case adds more reasons for the system to diverge from its original purpose without any pull to realign it.[^storey2026]

In systems with sufficient autonomy (where agents make consequential decisions unsupervised), intent debt becomes operational risk. A well-contextualized agent with no written intent is an arrow with excellent sighting but no target.

## Intent Artifacts: The Core Elements

Intent engineering materializes as three artifacts, each serving a distinct function:

**CONSTITUTION.md** is a human-first document of principles, guardrails, and non-negotiable organizational values.[^sdd2026] It is written for humans to read but structured for machines to enforce. A constitution might state: "All customer-facing communication must preserve transparency about system limitations" or "Cost optimization never takes precedence over data privacy." It is not a checklist of every decision; it is a hierarchy of what matters most when trade-offs arise.[^sdd2026]

**SPECIFICATION.md** encodes requirements in machine-parseable format, typically using EARS (Event-Driven, Ubiquitous, State-driven, Optional feature, Conditional).[^sdd2026] Specifications translate constitutional principles into testable conditions. If a constitution says "preserve transparency," a specification states: "When a system limitation is discovered, the agent must escalate to a human reviewer before proceeding." Specifications enable agents to verify that a planned action is permissible before execution.

**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** breaks down work into atomic tasks with [P] markers indicating which tasks can run in parallel and which must be sequential.[^sdd2026] The plan itself becomes a control boundary: agents know exactly what they are permitted to modify, and hooks can enforce that they do not drift beyond the plan's scope.

Together, these three artifacts form the backbone of Spec-Driven Development (SDD), a workflow that has demonstrated measurable reductions in both intent drift and security defects.[^sdd2025]

## Spec-Driven Development as Intent Engineering Method

Spec-Driven Development organizes agent-assisted work across three phases, each with distinct artifacts and approval gates:[^sdd2025]

1. Human and Planner draft a CONSTITUTION.md and SPECIFICATION.md in Ask mode (no file writes)
2. Human and Specification Engineer refine specifications into an IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
3. **Human approval gate** (critical control point, agent cannot proceed without explicit sign-off)
4. Agent enters implementation phase with write permissions scoped to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md only
5. Agent generates test cases and implementation code
6. Code review phase gates merge to main branch

The human gate between specification and implementation is the most important control mechanism in the entire workflow.[^sdd2025] The agent cannot enter Agent mode (the mode where it has write permissions) until a human has reviewed and approved the plan. This is not a suggestion or a soft boundary; it is a technical boundary enforced by the orchestration layer.

Research on constitutional AI (arXiv:2602.02584) shows that SDD reduces security defects by 73% compared to unconstrained AI-assisted development.[^sdd2024] The mechanism is not that the specification is perfect; it is that explicit review of the plan before implementation surfaces misalignments between intent and execution when they are still fixable.[^sdd2025]

Human-in-the-loop refinement of test cases matters more than which model generates the initial draft.[^sdd2025] A Sonnet-generated test case that a human has reviewed and refined catches more intent drift than an Opus-generated test case that was never explicitly validated. The human's judgment (their ability to recognize when a test is missing a constraint or when a plan does not fully reflect what the organization actually wants) is irreplaceable.

## The Planner-Coder Gap: Why Specification Quality is a Security Issue

A study of multi-agent system failures found that 75.3% of MAS failures originate from the gap between the planner and the coder[^plannercoder]. When the planner creates ambiguous or incomplete specifications, the coder generates insecure or incorrect code. This isn't just a quality problem. It's a security vector. An attacker who can influence the planner's output (through prompt injection or context manipulation) can cause the coder to generate vulnerable code without any direct attack on the coder itself[^plannercoder].

This finding is the strongest empirical justification I've seen for SDD's approach. The SPECIFICATION.md artifact isn't bureaucratic overhead. It's the interface between planning and coding. When that interface is explicit, machine-parseable, and human-reviewed, you eliminate the gap where 75.3% of failures originate. When the interface is implicit (a vague task description, a casual prompt), you're leaving three-quarters of your failure surface unaddressed.

## Behavioral Drivers: What Successful Agent Trajectories Look Like

A study of 9,374 agent trajectories across 19 agents (8 frameworks, 14 LLMs) found a consistent pattern that distinguishes success from failure[^behavioral]. The sequence is: understand, reproduce, fix, verify. Agents that gather context before editing succeed. Agents that jump to editing without understanding the problem fail, even on simple-patch tasks that should be straightforward.

The study also confirmed what I discussed in Chapter 3: LLM capability is a larger driver of success than framework design[^behavioral]. Two agents running the same model on different frameworks converge on more tasks than two agents on the same framework with different models. For intent engineering, this means the quality of your specification matters more than the tooling that consumes it. Invest in CONSTITUTION.md and SPECIFICATION.md before investing in framework selection.

For practitioners, the implication is direct: structure your agent prompts and hooks to enforce the understand-reproduce-fix-verify pattern. A preToolUse hook could require the agent to describe what it understands about the problem before it's allowed to write code. This one constraint eliminates a significant class of failures.

## SDD and VS Code Integration: Mapping to Language Primitives

The SDD workflow maps directly to VS Code modes and Claude model selections:[^sdd2025]

| SDD Layer | VS Code Mode | Model | Primitive |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| CONSTITUTION.md | Ask | Opus 4.6 | Planner agent |
| SPECIFICATION.md | Ask | Opus 4.6 | /spec prompt |
| IMPL_PLAN.md | Ask | Opus 4.6 | Planner + handoff |
| **Human Review Gate** | - | - | - |
| TDD specs | Edit | Sonnet 4.6 | /tdd prompt |
| Implementation | Agent | Sonnet 4.6 | Implementer + hooks |
| Code Review | Ask | Opus 4.6 | Reviewer (read-only) |

Ask mode is the conversation between human and planner. The planner drafts artifacts, the human responds with feedback, and the planner revises. No files are written until approval.

The human review gate is a hard stop. No progression to Agent mode without explicit human sign-off on the implementation plan.

Edit mode is where humans and smaller models collaborate on test specifications. TDD drives specification refinement before code is written.

Agent mode is where the implementer has scoped write permissions. Hooks (described below) enforce that writes occur only within the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md scope.

## Hooks as Zero-Cost Intent Enforcement

A preToolUse hook is a lightweight function that intercepts an agent's request to use a tool (typically a file write) and decides whether to permit it.[^sdd2024] Hooks require no model tokens. They are shell commands running in the orchestration layer.

A hook enforcing spec-driven discipline might look like:

```
If tool is 'write_file' AND file_path is NOT in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
  Block the write.
  Return: "File not in scope. Approved scope: [list from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md]"
```

This is a zero-friction mechanism for preventing scope creep. The agent proposes; the hook enforces. If the agent tries to edit a file outside the plan, the hook catches it immediately, the agent sees the constraint, and the human can decide whether to amend the plan.

Zero-cost enforcement is critical at scale. Token accounting favors solutions that do not require model inference to make control decisions. Hooks shift that decision to a simple conditional in the orchestration layer.

## The Testing Gap: Why Agent-Generated Tests Don't Verify Intent

There's a subtle problem with agent-generated tests that I want to call out, because it directly undermines intent verification. A study of 6 LLMs on SWE-bench Verified found that 74.4% of Claude Opus 4.5 traces include tests written by the agent[^agenttests]. That sounds impressive until you look at what those tests actually do. The tests serve as observational feedback (similar to print statements) rather than assertion-based checks[^agenttests]. The agent uses tests to observe whether its code runs, not to verify whether the code satisfies intent. And the correlation between test-writing and task success is weak: GPT-5.2 achieved 71.8% success while writing near-zero tests[^agenttests].

The implication for intent engineering is critical. Agents that generate their own tests are not verifying intent. They're verifying syntax. An SDD workflow must treat test generation and intent verification as separate concerns. The SPECIFICATION.md defines what should be tested. The human reviews whether the generated tests actually test those things. Otherwise, you get a comforting green test suite that proves nothing about whether the agent's output matches organizational intent.

A related study on LLM test generation under software evolution found that with semantic changes (SAC), pass rates drop from 79% to 66% and branch coverage drops from 76% to 60%[^testevolution]. LLMs depend on surface-level patterns, not semantic reasoning. When you refactor code without changing behavior, the tests should still pass. But when you change semantics, LLM-generated tests often fail to catch the difference[^testevolution]. This means that after any significant refactoring, teams should regenerate and manually review tests rather than trusting that existing AI-generated tests still capture the right intent.

## Preserving Human Skills in an Agent-Driven Workflow

There's one more dimension of intent engineering that goes beyond artifacts and tools: preserving the human capabilities that make intent engineering possible in the first place. A randomized experiment found that AI use during learning reduces library-specific skill acquisition by 17%[^skillformation]. Three interaction patterns preserve skills: conceptual inquiry (asking "why does this work?" before "write this code"), hybrid code-explanation (requesting both code and its reasoning), and generation-then-comprehension (generating code, then working through it line by line)[^skillformation].

These patterns should be encoded into your team's operating procedures. New team members should first understand the concepts behind CONSTITUTION.md and SPECIFICATION.md through the conceptual inquiry pattern before using agents to generate them. This isn't philosophical. It's practical. A team that can't reason about intent because they've delegated that reasoning to agents is a team that can no longer verify whether agent output matches organizational goals. The skill of writing and evaluating specifications is precisely the skill that must be preserved.

## Measuring Intent Alignment: The Metrics That Matter

You cannot govern what you cannot measure. Intent engineering introduces new metrics that serve as early warning signals for intent drift:[^storey2026]

**Scope creep rate per agent session** measures how often an agent proposes work outside the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md scope. A rising rate indicates either insufficiently detailed plans or agents that are not respecting constraints. Either way, it is a signal to pause and refine intent artifacts.

**Percentage of edits outside IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** tracks what the hook enforcement reveals. In healthy systems, this percentage should trend toward zero as intent clarity improves.

**Human review time per agent-generated pull request** is a leading indicator of cognitive load. If human reviewers are spending increasing time per PR, it may signal that plans are under-specified or that intent artifacts are not sufficiently clear to guide implementation decisions.

**Cognitive debt indicators** are harder to quantify but critically important:[^storey2026] onboarding time for new team members (rising time suggests intent knowledge is concentrated and undocumented), knowledge concentration index (how many people can explain why a given constraint exists), and reluctance to modify specific files (a strong signal that hidden intent lives in those files).

These metrics do not answer whether intent was satisfied; they indicate whether the system is drifting from stated intent or whether intent was never stated clearly to begin with.

## The LLM Is the Primary Driver of Outcome

A 2026 study of 9,374 agent trajectories across eight organizations found a counterintuitive result: agents sharing the same LLM converge on far more tasks than agents sharing the same framework.[^lmoutcome2026]

The implication is direct: model choice is a first-order decision that affects baseline behavior, risk tolerance, and what kinds of failures are likely. Framework choice is second-order. Two agents built on Claude Opus with different frameworks agree more often than two agents using the same framework if one runs on Sonnet and the other on a smaller model.

For intent engineering, this means that model selection should be driven by organizational risk tolerance and the nature of intent that needs to be encoded. A system where an agent makes autonomous financial decisions requires a different model than a system where an agent drafts documentation. The model's judgment (its tendency to err on the side of caution, its resistance to pressure, its ability to recognize ambiguity) is a first-order governance lever.[^lmoutcome2026]

## The Cost of Overthinking

Extended thinking (reasoning steps where the model reasons through a problem over many tokens before responding) is seductive when dealing with complex implementation tasks. It is also expensive and, for iterative work, often counterproductive.

A 2025 study of 4,018 trajectories on SWE-Bench (Software Engineering Benchmark) found that extended thinking adds 43% to token costs and degrades solution quality by 30% on iterative implementation tasks.[^overthinking2025] The degradation occurs because extended reasoning creates confidence in locally coherent plans that do not account for changes in the specification midway through execution. In iterative work where plans are refined as humans review intermediate outputs, extended thinking locks the agent into a path that becomes misaligned as the specification evolves.

For intent engineering workflows, this suggests a clearer division: use extended thinking in the Ask mode phase where plans are being drafted and reviewed, not in Agent mode where the plan is fixed and the agent should execute against it directly.

## Synthesis: From Intent to Accountability

Intent engineering shifts governance from supervision of outputs to specification of intent before execution. It moves the critical human judgment upstream (into the specification phase) where it can be documented and reused rather than applied reactively when something goes wrong.

The mechanisms are concrete: CONSTITUTION.md and SPECIFICATION.md encode what should happen. Hooks enforce what is permitted. Metrics surface when drift occurs. Human gates prevent agents from entering execution mode without explicit approval of the plan.

No organization has perfect intent artifacts. Intent engineering is an iterative refinement process, not a solved state. But organizations that systematize this refinement (that treat intent as an artifact category worthy of the same rigor applied to code) report significantly lower rates of misalignment, faster onboarding of new team members, and greater ability to modify systems without unintended side effects.[^storey2026]

The difference between a well-contextualized agent and an agent with well-encoded intent is the difference between giving someone excellent situational awareness and giving them a map, a destination, and clear instructions about what trade-offs they are authorized to make. Both matter. Intent engineering ensures both are present.

There's one more layer that became necessary in early 2026 to operate intent at production scale: harness engineering. The hooks I described in this chapter ("Hooks as Zero-Cost Intent Enforcement"), the SDD workflow with its human approval gate, the trajectory observability, and the `CONSTITUTION.md` plus `SPECIFICATION.md` artifacts are all components of what Martin Fowler calls a production agent harness. Chapter 6 names that operating discipline explicitly and shows how the four layers of this stack compose into a coherent harness, materialized through one of two accelerators (Three Horizons on RHDH plus ARO, or Open Horizons on Backstage plus AKS) on a shared Microsoft foundation. If intent engineering is the strategic layer of the agent, harness engineering is the operating model that runs it.
