# The Agentic DevOps Platform Bridge

> **Purpose.** This document is a bridge, not a chapter. It connects the canonical white paper (strategic thesis), the Context Platform Stack playbook (operational discipline), and the Open Horizons accelerator (deployable reference) into a single coherent narrative. It is the working skeleton for the next deck.

---

## 1. The Three Artifacts and How They Relate

The body of work on Agentic DevOps Platforms now consists of three artifacts, each sitting at a different altitude.

| Altitude | Artifact | Audience | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | **Canonical White Paper** (v1.0, 2026-04-22) | CxO, VP Eng, Platform Director, GBB sponsors | Anchors the thesis, cites the 2025-2026 evidence, positions Open Horizons as accelerator |
| Operational | **Context Platform Stack Playbook** (v1.2.0, 2026-04-11, chapters 00-05) | Platform Lead, AI-Native Tech Lead, Staff Engineer | Teaches the four-layer discipline with opinionated patterns and LATAM constraints |
| Executable | **Open Horizons Accelerator** (v5.0.0) | Platform team, DevOps engineer, customer delivery | Ships the code: 22 Golden Paths, 17 Copilot Chat agents, 16 Terraform modules, 15 MCP servers |

The three are co-dependent. The white paper without the playbook is a slide with no execution guide. The playbook without Open Horizons is a framework with no reference implementation. Open Horizons without the upper two is a codebase without a thesis. Together, they form the full stack for an enterprise selling, teaching, and delivering Agentic DevOps.

---

## 2. The Unified Mapping

The core of this bridge is a single crosswalk that proves the three artifacts are aligned. Read left to right: the Context Platform Stack layer, the CNCF Four Pillar that governs it, and the Open Horizons components that materialize it.

### 2.1 The Master Crosswalk

| Stack Layer (Playbook) | Canonical Role (White Paper) | CNCF Four Pillar | Open Horizons Component (Accelerator) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1: Cloud and Infrastructure** | Substrate for everything above | Enabling foundation (precondition to Guardrails) | AKS + ACR + Key Vault + VNet + PostgreSQL + Redis (16 Terraform modules); H1 template `infrastructure-provisioning` |
| **Layer 2: Platform Engineering** | The foundation layer of the AI-native enterprise | **Golden Paths** | 22 Backstage scaffolder templates (H1: 6, H2: 9, H3: 7) exposed via Open Horizons Backstage portal |
| **Layer 2: Platform Engineering (cont.)** | Governance middleware | **Guardrails** | OPA Gatekeeper policies, Azure Policy bundles, Workload Identity, NSGs, signed-image admission |
| **Layer 2: Platform Engineering (cont.)** | Self-healing substrate | **Safety Nets** | ArgoCD self-heal sync, Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager, Velero backups, progressive-delivery defaults, 4 Grafana dashboards |
| **Layer 2: Platform Engineering (cont.)** | Accountability control | **Manual Review** | ArgoCD environment-specific sync (dev auto, staging gated, prod manual), Change Advisory via GitHub Issues templates, AI agent promotion gates |
| **Layer 3: Context Engineering** | The knowledge and retrieval surface | Enabled by Golden Paths and Guardrails | 15 MCP servers, Backstage service catalog and TechDocs, `rag-application` and `ai-evaluation-pipeline` H3 templates, Azure AI Search / pgvector |
| **Layer 4: Intent Engineering** | Codified goals and specifications | Governs Safety Nets and Manual Review | `foundry-agent`, `multi-agent-system`, `copilot-extension` H3 templates; 28 GitHub Issues templates encoding workflows; 14 automation scripts enforcing policy |
| **Layer 5 (derived): Agentic Execution** | The production agent surface | Governed by all four pillars | `sre-agent-integration`, `foundry-agent`, 17 GitHub Copilot Chat agents, Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit integration |

### 2.2 What the Crosswalk Proves

Three points become undeniable once the mapping is laid out:

1. **Open Horizons is not an alternative to the stack; it is the stack's executable form.** Every box in the Open Horizons component column is the answer to a "how do I actually do this?" question the playbook raises.
2. **The Four Pillars of Platform Control are not a layer of their own; they are the *governance semantics* of Layer 2.** Golden Paths, Guardrails, Safety Nets, and Manual Review are the operational vocabulary by which Platform Engineering governs every layer above it.
3. **Layers 3 and 4 (Context and Intent) depend on Layer 2's governance primitives.** A context graph without the platform's Guardrails produces hallucination at enterprise scale. Intent captured in scripts without the platform's Manual Review produces agents that escape their scope. The dependency arrow is unambiguous.

### 2.3 The Three Horizons as a Maturity Path Through the Stack

Open Horizons organizes its 22 Golden Paths into H1 Foundation (6), H2 Enhancement (9), and H3 Innovation (7). The Three Horizons map cleanly onto the stack layers as a maturity progression.

| Horizon | Stack Coverage | CNCF Pillars Exercised | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H1 Foundation** | Layer 1 fully, Layer 2 Golden Paths and Guardrails | Golden Paths, Guardrails (Safety Nets baseline) | Platform usable by three teams inside 90 days |
| **H2 Enhancement** | Layer 2 complete, Layer 3 baseline (catalog, docs, lineage) | All four pillars exercised on human-driven workloads | Platform adopted by 50%+ of eligible workloads inside 6 months |
| **H3 Innovation** | Layers 3 and 4 at enterprise scale, first Layer 5 agentic workloads | All four pillars exercised on agent-driven workloads | First production agent workload inside 12 months |

This is the sequencing the canonical white paper calls "90 days / 6 months / 12 months" and the playbook calls "the stacking rule." The horizons are the *tempo*, the stack is the *architecture*, and Open Horizons is the *code*.

---

## 3. How Open Horizons Materializes Each Layer

This section is the crosswalk restated as narrative. It is the part that becomes slide copy in the next deck.

### 3.1 Layer 1 Materialized

The 16 Terraform modules in Open Horizons provision the full infrastructure substrate: AKS with Workload Identity, Azure Container Registry, Key Vault with private endpoint, VNet with NSGs, Azure CNI, Managed PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure AI Foundry. The `infrastructure-provisioning` Golden Path makes the modules themselves a self-service primitive. A platform team that adopts Open Horizons does not start from `main.tf`; it starts from "which modules do we keep, which do we tune?"

### 3.2 Layer 2 Materialized

Backstage is the developer-facing surface. The 22 scaffolder templates are the Golden Paths. OPA Gatekeeper, Azure Policy, Workload Identity, and NSGs are the Guardrails, enforced at admission. ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and Velero are the Safety Nets, reconciling and recovering continuously. ArgoCD's environment-specific sync policies plus 28 GitHub Issues templates are the Manual Review surface.

The key design choice in Open Horizons is that Layer 2 is *fully wired at deploy time*. There is no "now please configure Backstage" step for the customer. The accelerator ships with Backstage branded, authenticated, and populated, with the Golden Paths live.

### 3.3 Layer 3 Materialized

Context lives in three surfaces that Open Horizons instantiates: the Backstage service catalog and TechDocs (which cover component, API, and documentation context), the 15 MCP servers (which expose Azure, GitHub, and observability context to agents through a standard protocol), and the `rag-application` H3 template (which provisions a vector store, ingestion pipeline, and evaluation harness). The `ai-evaluation-pipeline` template adds the feedback loop that makes context *improvable* rather than static.

This is the concrete answer to the DataHub 88% paradox cited in the canonical: context-as-priority only works when the platform provides the primitives to keep context fresh, attributed, and evaluated. Open Horizons ships those primitives.

### 3.4 Layer 4 Materialized

Intent is codified in three places: the `foundry-agent` and `multi-agent-system` H3 templates (which define agent goals, scope, and permission boundaries in code), the 28 GitHub Issues templates (which capture organizational workflows as typed artifacts), and the 14 automation scripts (which encode validation and promotion logic as executable policy). The Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit integration handles the enterprise-wide agent register, permission scope review, and promotion gating.

Intent without codification is the intent debt the playbook warns about. Open Horizons removes the debt by making every intent artifact a version-controlled, reviewable, deployable object.

### 3.5 Layer 5 Materialized

The 17 GitHub Copilot Chat agents are the most visible Layer 5 surface. Each is scoped, context-bound, and auditable. They execute the 2026 Dual Mandate: they use AI to make the platform team more effective (Mandate A, internal velocity) and they serve as the onboarding accelerator for application teams adopting the platform (Mandate B, external velocity).

The `sre-agent-integration` template and the `foundry-agent` template are the customer-facing Layer 5 surfaces: production agents that consume the platform's full governance stack. An agent deployed through these templates inherits the identity, observability, policy, and review workflow of the platform automatically. That inheritance is what makes agent deployment safe at enterprise scale.

## 4. Skeleton for the Next Deck

With the three artifacts aligned, the deck structure follows almost deterministically. The deck is a compression of the white paper's thesis, the playbook's discipline, and the accelerator's concreteness into roughly 30-40 slides.

### 4.1 Proposed Section Structure

| Section | Slides | Purpose | Primary Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Opening** | 2-3 | State the thesis. Establish the urgency. | Canonical, Section 1 |
| **Part 1. Why the Foundation Is Decisive in 2026** | 5-7 | Amplification thesis. DORA, MIT NANDA, Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester, IDC convergence. | Canonical, Sections 2 and 4 |
| **Part 2. The Four Layers of the Context Platform Stack** | 6-8 | Pyramid, stacking rule, Triple Debt. Each layer's job. | Playbook 00-04 + Canonical Section 3 |
| **Part 3. The Four Pillars as Governance Semantics** | 4-5 | Golden Paths, Guardrails, Safety Nets, Manual Review. Re-expressed as AI control plane. | Playbook 02 + Canonical Section 5 |
| **Part 4. Open Horizons as Accelerator** | 8-10 | Component inventory. Three Horizons (H1/H2/H3). Crosswalk to pillars and layers. Deploy-time compression. | Canonical Section 8 + Open Horizons README |
| **Part 5. Sequence: 90 Days, 6 Months, 12 Months** | 4-5 | The implementation plan, deliverable by deliverable. | Canonical Section 10 |
| **Closing** | 2-3 | The Dual Mandate. The call to action. | Canonical Sections 7 and 11 |

### 4.2 Hero Slide (The One Slide to Keep If You Lose Every Other Slide)

The hero slide for this deck carries the core formula and the master crosswalk in a single frame.

```
Platform Engineering (foundation)
       + Open Horizons (accelerator)
       = Agentic DevOps Platform (outcome)

Layer 1 Cloud + Infra       -> 16 Terraform modules
Layer 2 Platform Eng        -> 22 Golden Paths + 4 Pillars wired
Layer 3 Context Eng         -> 15 MCP servers + RAG template
Layer 4 Intent Eng          -> 28 issue templates + Agent Gov Toolkit
Layer 5 Agentic Execution   -> 17 Copilot Chat agents + H3 templates

Time to first production AI workload: 9-18 months  ->  90-180 days
```

This single frame is the whole story. Every other slide is elaboration.

### 4.3 Proof Points to Scatter Across the Deck

The deck works because the data points are real and convergent. Distribute these across slides rather than stacking them:

- DORA 2025: 90% IDP adoption; AI as amplifier, not universal booster. Elite performers +20-30% productivity; low performers net negative.
- MIT NANDA 2025: 95% GenAI pilot failure rate, concentrated in context, integration, and governance gaps.
- Gartner 2025: 40% of agentic AI projects will be cancelled by 2027.
- CNCF 2026: Four Pillars reframed as AI control plane. Dual Mandate for platform teams.
- McKinsey 2025: 2.5x faster AI ROI in platform-mature organizations.
- Forrester Q1 2026: 4-6x time-to-production compression with productized platform.
- IDC February 2026: 73% of enterprises planning agentic AI lack platform prerequisites; of the 27% that have them, 61% already in production versus 8% in the 73%.
- DataHub 88% paradox: context as priority vs. data quality as blocker. Platform primitives are the resolution.

## 5. What the Bridge Does Not Do (Explicit Scope)

The bridge is deliberately narrow. It does *not*:

- Replace the playbook chapters. The depth on Context Engineering (ch. 03) and Intent Engineering (ch. 04) stays in the playbook.
- Replace the canonical. The evidence synthesis and sourcing stay in the canonical.
- Document Open Horizons at tutorial depth. The Administrator Guide, Architecture Guide, and Deployment Guide stay canonical for operational depth.

The bridge exists so that the *next deck* and any *exec-level narrative* can be built without re-deriving the mapping from first principles. It is a working skeleton, not a replacement for the depth beneath it.

---

## 6. Recommended Next Actions

Three deliverables follow naturally from this bridge.

1. **The Deck**. Build from Section 4 of this document. Target 30-40 slides. Use `ms-presentation-engine` (for standalone HTML with keyboard-nav slides and language switching) or `ms-gamma-presenter` (for client-facing Gamma). The hero slide in Section 4.2 is non-negotiable.

2. **A Single-Page Executive Brief**. A one-page PDF that compresses the canonical thesis + the crosswalk table into a leave-behind after exec meetings. Derived directly from Sections 1 and 2 of this bridge.

3. **The PT-BR and ES Canonical Translations**. The canonical white paper needs locale versions per the trilingual publishing standard. The bridge itself can stay EN-only because it is internal scaffolding.

---

## 7. Closing

The three altitudes, aligned:

- **Strategic**: *Why the foundation is decisive.* Canonical white paper.
- **Operational**: *How the four layers work.* Context Platform Stack playbook.
- **Executable**: *What to deploy.* Open Horizons accelerator.

Each depends on the other two. Together, they are the full answer to "how do we become an AI-native enterprise?"

The answer compresses to one sentence: **Build the platform first, codify it with Open Horizons, and the layers above it (context, intent, agents) become tractable in 90 to 180 days instead of 9 to 18 months.**

That is the deck.
